## 🎬 How to View

1. Your dev server is already running at `http://localhost:3000`
2. Navigate to the home page
3. Scroll down past the hero section
4. You'll see the new "Our Services" section
5. **Hover over each card** to see the yellow bottom-left accent and all animations!

## 🔧 Customization Options

You can easily customize:

- **Services**: Edit the `services` array in `OurServicesSection.tsx`
- **Colors**: All colors use CSS variables from `globals.css`
- **Icons**: Import different icons from `lucide-react`
- **Stats**: Update the stats array in the CTA section
- **Animation timing**: Adjust `duration` and `delay` values

## 🎨 Key Design Elements

### Yellow Bottom-Left Accent (Your Main Request!)

```typescript
<div
  className="absolute bottom-0 left-0 transition-all duration-500"
  style={{
    width: isHovered ? "60px" : "0px",
    height: isHovered ? "60px" : "0px",
    backgroundColor: "#FFD700",
    clipPath: "polygon(0 0, 100% 100%, 0 100%)",
    opacity: isHovered ? 1 : 0,
  }}
/>
```

This creates a triangle that:

- Starts at 0px × 0px (hidden)
- Expands to 60px × 60px on hover
- Uses clip-path to create triangle shape
- Smooth 500ms transition
- Positioned in bottom-left corner

## 🎯 What Makes It Creative

1. **Multi-layered Animations**: Each card has 8+ different animated elements
2. **Particle Effects**: Floating dots that appear on hover
3. **Geometric Shapes**: Spinning decorative elements in background
4. **Gradient Overlays**: Subtle color transitions
5. **Staggered Timing**: Each element animates at different speeds
6. **3D-like Effects**: Cards lift and rotate on hover
7. **Shine Effects**: Light sweeps across buttons
8. **Pulse Animations**: Background blur elements pulse
9. **Border Animations**: Sliding gradient borders
10. **Stats Counter Section**: Professional metrics display

## 🎨 Separation of Concerns

Each component is **fully independent and reusable**:

- `ServiceCard` can be used anywhere you need a service card
- `ServiceButton` can be used for any CTA
- `OurServicesSection` orchestrates everything

## 📝 Next Steps

To see it in action:

1. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser
2. Scroll to the services section
3. Hover over each card to see the magic! ✨

The yellow accent in the bottom-left corner will slide in smoothly, just like in your reference image!
